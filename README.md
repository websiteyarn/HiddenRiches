## Overview

**_The Hidden Riche_** is a treasure hunting game where treasures are hidden in every corner
of a cave and the player tries to discover all of the five treasures to win the game. Treasures are
locked in treasure chests and while there are numerous unopened treasure chests dispersed all
over the place, not many of them contain the real treasure. The pirate is the opponent who will capture the
player once detected. The player must be quick and careful to not let the pirate steal the obtained
treasure from him.
